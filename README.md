Hey everyone!

I'm Raymond Guerrero, I go by Ray. I'm new to software development and currently going through a software development intership
with The KYO Group. Over the next 6 months I will be learning HTML / CSS / Javascript and more as I look forwards to a new career
oustide of the military. 

I am still learning, it's true. I don't have as much experience as some people do in this field, what I do have though is a decade long career as a Technology Management professional with experience in technical product and program management, successfully leading large-scale IT and cybersecurity projects. I've seved as a trusted advisor to CxO-level executives, led cross-functional teams in fast-paced environments, a proven track record of managing complex projects

All I ask if for a chance to prove that I can accomplish whatever goal you have, whatever bar you set, I will get there. Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio and please feel free to reach out and ask questions about my journey in software development or my career in the military. 

-Ray Guerrero
